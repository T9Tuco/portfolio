## what is this place?

this is where i show off my projects and pretend i know what i'm doing. it's built with good old HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript magic. no fancy frameworks, just pure, unadulterated code.

## features (or lack thereof)

- **Looks okay on your phone:** i mean, who uses a desktop anymore?
- **Things move:** because animations are cool, right?
- **A cat that follows your mouse:** because the internet is for cats.

## tech stack (the stuff that makes it go 'brrr')

- **HTML5:** the skeleton of the operation.
- **CSS3:** to make it look pretty (or at least, not completely broken).
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** for the cool kids. this is where the magic happens.
- **Font Awesome:** because i can't draw my own icons.
- **oneko.js:** the aforementioned cat. you're welcome.

## how to run this thing
